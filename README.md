# Library of Edinburgh

A pointless project combining Jorge Luis Borges' *Library of Babel* with David
Hume's *Treatise of Human Nature*. Because it's Hume, the volumes will be generated
probabilistically. A server written in Go does the text processing and serves as
the api (and, temporarily, static file server) for a front end React app.

This is very much a work in progress.
